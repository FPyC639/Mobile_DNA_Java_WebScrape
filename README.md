# Mobile_DNA_Java_WebScrape

This web scraper is a work in progress application I built based on DS 636 at NJIT. It is a pinnacle of Data Science enviroment being used in R. This is a small project that will gather and perform an analysis on titles using Natural Language Processing.


# Update 20240109

In this update the search parameters were updated for the Web Scraper and exception handling was accounted for a few test cases that were generated.
